=========================
First release, alpha version of the bot. Here is what it can do now:
- add and import from file user-defined chinese words, translated to his native language;
- parse chinese characters, detect a pinyin in the words and highlight the tones;
- generate flash cards;
- 4 learning modes - writing, pronunciation, translation and just viewing;
- trace your progress;
- work in the inline mode - you can find in your dictionary and send to other user a flash card with a word;
- 5 modes of showing words  - random, the newest first, the olders first, the newest and the hardest (based on your progress), the oldest and hardest.

Limitations: 
- you cannot import more than 70 words at once or a file bigger than 10 KB;
- maximum chinese word length is 15 characters;
- maximum translation length is 100 characters.

What I want to add:
- cheer-message after each 10 successfully learnt words;
- a pop-up message with the last 10 seen words in the inline mode;
- the 6th mode for learning specified group of words, for example 20 words from a new text.
